# spaCy examples

The examples are Python scripts with well-behaved command line interfaces. For
more detailed usage guides, see the [documentation](https://spacy.io/usage/).

To see the available arguments, you can use the `--help` or `-h` flag:

```bash
$ python examples/training/train_ner.py --help
```

While we try to keep the examples up to date, they are not currently exercised
by the test suite, as some of them require significant data downloads or take
time to train. If you find that an example is no longer running,
[please tell us](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues)! We know there's
nothing worse than trying to figure out what you're doing wrong, and it turns
out your code was never the problem.
