    |  Inflectional morphology is the process by which a root form of a word is
    |  modified by adding prefixes or suffixes that specify its grammatical
    |  function but do not changes its part-of-speech. We say that a
    |  #[strong lemma] (root form) is #[strong inflected] (modified/combined)
    |  with one or more #[strong morphological features] to create a surface
    |  form. Here are some examples:

    |  English has a relatively simple morphological system, which spaCy
    |  handles using rules that can be keyed by the token, the part-of-speech
    |  tag, or the combination of the two. The system works as follows:

+list("numbers")
    +item
        |  The tokenizer consults a
        |  #[+a("/usage/adding-languages#tokenizer-exceptions") mapping table]
        |  #[code TOKENIZER_EXCEPTIONS], which allows sequences of characters
        |  to be mapped to multiple tokens. Each token may be assigned a part
        |  of speech and one or more morphological features.

    +item
        |  The part-of-speech tagger then assigns each token an
        |  #[strong extended POS tag]. In the API, these tags are known as
        |  #[code Token.tag]. They express the part-of-speech (e.g.
        |  #[code VERB]) and some amount of morphological information, e.g.
        |  that the verb is past tense.

    +item
        |  For words whose POS is not set by a prior process, a
        |  #[+a("/usage/adding-languages#tag-map") mapping table]
        |  #[code TAG_MAP] maps the tags to a part-of-speech and a set of
        |  morphological features.

    +item
        |  Finally, a #[strong rule-based deterministic lemmatizer] maps the
        |  surface form, to a lemma in light of the previously assigned
        |  extended part-of-speech and morphological information, without
        |  consulting the context of the token. The lemmatizer also accepts
        |  list-based exception files, acquired from
        |  #[+a("https://wordnet.princeton.edu/") WordNet].

    |  For a list of the fine-grained and coarse-grained part-of-speech tags
    |  assigned by spaCy's models across different languages, see the
    |  #[+a("/api/annotation#pos-tagging") POS tag scheme documentation].
