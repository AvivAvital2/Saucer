    |  When you call #[code nlp] on a text, spaCy first tokenizes the text to
    |  produce a #[code Doc] object. The #[code Doc] is then processed in several
    |  different steps â€“ this is also referred to as the
    |  #[strong processing pipeline]. The pipeline used by the
    |  #[+a("/models") default models] consists of a tagger, a parser and an
    |  entity recognizer. Each pipeline component returns the processed
    |  #[code Doc], which is then passed on to the next component.

p
    |  The processing pipeline always #[strong depends on the statistical model]
    |  and its capabilities. For example, a pipeline can only include an entity
    |  recognizer component if the model includes data to make predictions of
    |  entity labels. This is why each model will specify the pipeline to use
    |  in its meta data, as a simple list containing the component names:

+code(false, "json").
    "pipeline": ["tagger", "parser", "ner"]

p
    |  Although you can mix and match pipeline components, their
    |  #[strong order and combination] is usually important. Some components may
    |  require certain modifications on the #[code Doc] to process it. As the
    |  processing pipeline is applied, spaCy encodes the document's internal
    |  #[strong meaning representations] as an array of floats, also called a
    |  #[strong tensor]. This includes the tokens and their context, which is
    |  required for the first component, the tagger, to make predictions of the
    |  part-of-speech tags. Because spaCy's models are neural network models,
    |  they only "speak" tensors and expect the input #[code Doc] to have
    |  a #[code tensor].
