    |  Every language is different ‚Äì and usually full of
    |  #[strong exceptions and special cases], especially amongst the most
    |  common words. Some of these exceptions are shared across languages, while
    |  others are #[strong entirely specific] ‚Äì usually so specific that they need
    |  to be hard-coded. The #[+src(gh("spaCy", "spacy/lang")) #[code lang]] module
    |  contains all language-specific data, organised in simple Python files.
    |  This makes the data easy to update and extend.

p
    |  The #[strong shared language data] in the directory root includes rules
    |  that can be generalised across languages ‚Äì for example, rules for basic
    |  punctuation, emoji, emoticons, single-letter abbreviations and norms for
    |  equivalent tokens with different spellings, like #[code &quot;] and
    |  #[code ‚Äù]. This helps the models make more accurate predictions.
    |  The #[strong individual language data] in a submodule contains
    |  rules that are only relevant to a particular language. It also takes
    |  care of putting together all components and creating the #[code Language]
    |  subclass ‚Äì for example, #[code English] or #[code German].

            |  List of most common words of a language that are often useful to
