    |  We're very happy to see the spaCy community grow and include a mix of
    |  people from all kinds of different backgrounds ‚Äì computational
    |  linguistics, data science, deep learning, research and more. If you'd
    |  like to get involved, below are some answers to the most important
    |  questions and resources for further reading.

+h(3, "faq-help-code") Help, my code isn't working!

p
    |  Bugs suck, and we're doing our best to continuously improve the tests
    |  and fix bugs as soon as possible. Before you submit an issue, do a
    |  quick search and check if the problem has already been reported. If
    |  you're having installation or loading problems, make sure to also check
    |  out the #[+a("/usage/#troubleshooting") troubleshooting guide]. Help
    |  with spaCy is available via the following platforms:

+aside("How do I know if something is a bug?")
    |  Of course, it's always hard to know for sure, so don't worry ‚Äì we're not
    |  going to be mad if a bug report turns out to be a typo in your
    |  code. As a simple rule, any C-level error without a Python traceback,
    |  like a #[strong segmentation fault] or #[strong memory error],
    |  is #[strong always] a spaCy bug.#[br]#[br]
    |  Because models are statistical, their performance will never be
    |  #[em perfect]. However, if you come across
    |  #[strong patterns that might indicate an underlying issue], please do
    |  file a report. Similarly, we also care about behaviours that
    |  #[strong contradict our docs].

        +cell
            |  #[strong Usage questions] and everything related to problems with
            |  your specific code. The Stack Overflow community is much larger
            |  than ours, so if your problem can be solved by others, you'll
            |  receive help much quicker.

            |  share them on Gitter first.

            |  everything that's likely spaCy's fault. This also includes
            |  problems with the models beyond statistical imprecisions, like
            |  patterns that point to a bug.

+infobox
    |  Please understand that we won't be able to provide individual support via
    |  email. We also believe that help is much more valuable if it's shared
    |  publicly, so that #[strong more people can benefit from it]. If you come
    |  across an issue and you think you might be able to help, consider posting
    |  a quick update with your solution. No matter how simple, it can easily
    |  save someone a lot of time and headache ‚Äì and the next time you need help,
    |  they might repay the favour.

+h(3, "faq-contributing") How can I contribute to spaCy?

p
    |  You don't have to be an NLP expert or Python pro to contribute, and we're
    |  happy to help you get started. If you're new to spaCy, a good place to
    |  start is the
    |  #[+a(gh("spaCy") + '/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A"help+wanted+%28easy%29"') #[code help wanted (easy)] label]
    |  on GitHub, which we use to tag bugs and feature requests that are easy
    |  and self-contained. We also appreciate contributions to the docs ‚Äì whether
    |  it's fixing a typo, improving an example or adding additional explanations.
    |  You'll find a "Suggest edits" link at the bottom of each page that points
    |  you to the source.

p
    |  Another way of getting involved is to help us improve the
    |  #[+a("/usage/adding-languages#language-data") language data] ‚Äì
    |  especially if you happen to speak one of the languages currently in
    |  #[+a("/usage/models#languages") alpha support]. Even
    |  adding simple tokenizer exceptions, stop words or lemmatizer data
    |  can make a big difference. It will also make it easier for us to provide
    |  a statistical model for the language in the future. Submitting a test
    |  that documents a bug or performance issue, or covers functionality that's
    |  especially important for your application is also very helpful. This way,
    |  you'll also make sure we never accidentally introduce regressions to the
    |  parts of the library that you care about the most.

        |  For more details on the types of contributions we're looking for, the
        |  code conventions and other useful tips, make sure to check out the
        |  #[+a(gh("spaCy", "CONTRIBUTING.md")) contributing guidelines].

+infobox("Code of Conduct")
    |  spaCy adheres to the
    |  #[+a("http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/") Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct].
    |  By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

+h(3, "faq-project-with-spacy")
    |  I've built something cool with spaCy ‚Äì how can I get the word out?

p
    |  First, congrats ‚Äì we'd love to check it out! When you share your
    |  project on Twitter, don't forget to tag
    |  #[+a("https://twitter.com/" + SOCIAL.twitter) @#{SOCIAL.twitter}] so we
    |  don't miss it. If you think your project would be a good fit for the
    |  #[+a("/universe") spaCy Universe], #[strong feel free to submit it!]
    |  Tutorials are also incredibly valuable to other users and a great way to
    |  get exposure. So we strongly encourage #[strong writing up your experiences],
    |  or sharing your code and some tips and tricks on your blog. Since our
    |  website is open-source, you can add your project or tutorial by making a
    |  pull request on GitHub.

p
    |  If you would like to use the spaCy logo on your site, please get in touch
    |  and ask us first. However, if you want to show support and tell others
    |  that your project is using spaCy, you can grab one of our
    |  #[strong spaCy badges] here:
