        |  As of v2.0, our popular visualizers, #[+a(DEMOS_URL + "/displacy") displaCy]
        |  and #[+a(DEMOS_URL + "/displacy-ent") displaCy #[sup ENT]] are finally an
        |  official part of the library. Visualizing a dependency parse or named
        |  entities in a text is not only a fun NLP demo â€“ it can also be incredibly
        |  helpful in speeding up development and debugging your code and training
        |  process. If you're running a #[+a("https://jupyter.org") Jupyter] notebook,
        |  displaCy will detect this and return the markup in a format
        |  #[+a("#jupyter") ready to be rendered and exported].

    +aside("What about the old visualizers?")
        |  Our JavaScript-based visualizers #[+src(gh("displacy")) #[code displacy.js]] and
        |  #[+src(gh("displacy-ent")) #[code displacy-ent.js]] will still be available on
        |  GitHub. If you're looking to implement web-based visualizations, we
        |  generally recommend using those instead of spaCy's built-in
        |  #[code displacy] module. It'll allow your application to perform all
        |  rendering on the client and only rely on the server for the text
        |  processing. The generated markup is also more compatible with modern web
        |  standards.

    p
        |  The quickest way to visualize  #[code Doc] is to use
        |  #[+api("displacy#serve") #[code displacy.serve]]. This will spin up a
        |  simple web server and let you view the result straight from your browser.
        |  displaCy can either take a single #[code Doc] or a list of #[code Doc]
        |  objects as its first argument. This lets you construct them however you
        |  like â€“ using any model or modifications you like.
