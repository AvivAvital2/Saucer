    |  Processing raw text intelligently is difficult: most words are rare, and
    |  it's common for words that look completely different to mean almost the
    |  same thing. The same words in a different order can mean something
    |  completely different. Even splitting text into useful word-like units can
    |  be difficult in many languages. While it's possible to solve some
    |  problems starting from only the raw characters, it's usually better to
    |  use linguistic knowledge to add useful information. That's exactly what
    |  spaCy is designed to do: you put in raw text, and get back a
    |  #[+api("doc") #[code Doc]] object, that comes with a variety of
    |  annotations.
