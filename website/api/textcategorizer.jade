    |  The model supports classification with multiple, non-mutually exclusive
    |  labels. You can change the model architecture rather easily, but by
    |  default, the #[code TextCategorizer] class uses a convolutional
    |  neural network to assign position-sensitive vectors to each word in the
    |  document. The #[code TextCategorizer] uses its own CNN model, to
    |  avoid sharing weights with the other pipeline components. The document
    |  tensor is then summarized by concatenating max and mean pooling, and a
    |  multilayer perceptron is used to predict an output vector of length
    |  #[code nr_class], before a logistic activation is applied elementwise.
    |  The value of each output neuron is the probability that some class is
    |  present.
